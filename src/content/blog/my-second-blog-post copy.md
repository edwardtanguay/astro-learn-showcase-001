# Savory Spinach and Mushroom Quiche

## Ingredients:

-   1 pre-made pie crust
-   1 cup chopped spinach, fresh or frozen (thawed and drained)
-   1 cup sliced mushrooms
-   1/2 cup diced onion
-   1 cup shredded cheese (such as Swiss, cheddar, or Gruyère)
-   4 large eggs
-   1 cup milk or half-and-half
-   Salt and pepper to taste
-   Optional: 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg

## Instructions:

1. Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).
2. Roll out the pie crust and press it into a 9-inch pie dish, trimming any excess crust from the edges.
3. In a skillet over medium heat, sauté the mushrooms and onions until softened and lightly browned, about 5-7 minutes.
4. In a mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, salt, pepper, and nutmeg (if using) until well combined.
5. Spread the spinach evenly over the bottom of the pie crust, followed by the sautéed mushrooms and onions.
6. Sprinkle the shredded cheese over the vegetables.
7. Carefully pour the egg mixture over the cheese and vegetables, ensuring everything is evenly coated.
8. Place the quiche in the preheated oven and bake for 35-40 minutes, or until the center is set and the top is golden brown.
9. Remove from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving.
10. Enjoy your delicious savory spinach and mushroom quiche!
